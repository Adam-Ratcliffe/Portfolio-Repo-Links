# [D&D Notes Application](https://github.com/Adam-Ratcliffe/DnDNotesApplicationVue.git)
An application I created with the soul purpose of learning C#.NET Core 8 framework as well as learning how to utilise a connection to a MongoDB database. Additionally using my understanding of the Vue 3 front end framework that I have previously used to create an app that I would use to keep notes on the D&D games I run.
